# Score Prediction Companion

## Overview

Made to assist calculating points from predictions given by members from an online community

Original idea was to move the whole football prediction process onto its own website but that was too complex for me

So i made this: [Score Prediction Companion](https://prediction-companion.netlify.app/)

## Points system

+2 pts for getting correct outcome <br>
+3 pts for getting correct score <br>
+3 pts for getting correct first goal scorer

## Technical

Made using React using `create vite@latest` + typescript and css.

To set up locally, download the project, cd into the project, run `npm init`, then `npm run dev` to start a local server.
